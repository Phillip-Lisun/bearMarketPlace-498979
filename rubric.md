# Module 7 Creative Project Rubric

## Description

This will be a website that will allow WashU students to connect to buy/sell items. Users will be required to register, and then they will be able to post items for sale. Buyers will then be able to view products, and if buyer makes a request and the seller accepts, both users will be able to see contact information to further the sale. (The website will not be a point-of-sale and transactions will be handled by the individuals themselves).
